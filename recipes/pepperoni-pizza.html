    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> Who doesn't love Pepperoni Pizza? Now with this recipe, you can make Pizza at home
        whenever you want! </p>
    <p> Not only does it come together pretty quick and easily, but the end product will be
        even better than most Pizzas that you can buy! </p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
        <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
        <li>Flour for reolling and shaping dough</li>

        <h4>For the Quick Pizza Sauce:</h4>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated onion</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li> teaspoon olive oil</li>

        <h4>For the Honey Butter</h4>
        <li>1/4 cup softened butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <h4> <li> Preheat the oven </h4>
        <p> Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.</p></li>
    
        <h4><li> Make the sauce </h4>
            <p> If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients. The sauce
                recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. You can easily double it if you
                are making more than one pizza.
        </p></li>
    
        <h4><li> Roll out the dough</h4>
            <p> Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest 
                for  minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like
                to roll my dough into about a 13-inch diameter circle.</p></li>
    
        <h4><li> Add the Toppings </h4>
            <p> Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Aternatively,
                fit it into a large cast-iron </p>
            <p>Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust 
                around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and spinkle it over 
                the sauce. Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the 
                pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</p></li>

        <h4><li> Cook the Pizza </h4>            
            <p> Press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add toppings. Place the 
                skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get it preheated and
                get hte crust cooking right away. Then tranfer to a 500 degree F oven
                and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</p></li>
        <h4><li>Slice and server</h4>
            <p>Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the pizza
                rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh oregano (optiional).
                Serve while warm with a side salad.</p></li>
        <h4><li>Make the honey butter (optional)</h4>
            <p>Stir together the softened butter and honey, then serve alongside the pizza
                for crust dipping.</p></li>
     </ol>
